## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Header Transparency

**Problem**: Creating a header that transitions smoothly from transparent to frosted glass while maintaining text readability.

**Solution**:

```css

  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
}
```

**Solution**:

```javascript
menuItems.forEach((item) => {
  if (filter === "all" || category === filter) {
    item.style.display = "block";
    setTimeout(() => {
      item.style.opacity = "1";
      item.style.transform = "scale(1)";
